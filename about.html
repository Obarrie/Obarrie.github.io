        <h1> About me </h1>
        
        <p> Hi my name is Osman Barrie I am currrently going to the University of Rhode Island for my undergrad. My major is computer science. I <br>
        decided to switch my major from biology which I did my freshman year to computer science. I chose to switch my major because biology was <br>
        not something I was really interested in. Computer science even though it might be more diffclt seems to be more interesting to me. <br>
        Hopefully I am right and I do find my calling with this major. </p> 
            <br>
