        <h1> WELCOME TO MY PAGE</h1>
        
        <p> This is the first website I have ever created. It may be a little rough but I am hoping eventually I can fix that and <br>
            become better. I am hoping this is a start to something great. This is just the home page the other links lead to other websites <br>
            I have created like javascript which will be about more of animated coding. The other link "About Me" talks a little about me, what <br>
            high school I went to, what university I am attending, why i chose computer science and my future plans. </p>
